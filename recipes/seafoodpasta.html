			It’s almost Thanksgiving and we’re all about to pull our hair out, right??
			But in the middle of all this madness, we still need to eat. So, I reached
			into my pantry today to make up a quick pasta dish using leftovers I had
			on hand. This Spicy Seafood Pasta with Tomato Butter Sauce is a hybrid of
			my Spicy Shrimp Tomato Pasta and 5-Ingredient Butter Tomato Sauce. Both of
			these recipes are great bases that can be customized to accommodate
			leftovers, like the 1/2 pound of frozen seafood mix from Trader Joe’s that
			I had in my freezer.

		<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>4 Tbsp butter, divided</li>
			<li>8 oz frozen seafood mix*</li>
			<li>4 cloves garlic</li>
			<li>28 oz can whole peeled tomatoes</li>
			<li>1/4 tsp red pepper flakes (optional)</li>
			<li>8 oz fettuccine</li>
			<li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
			<li>Handful fresh parsley (optional garnish)</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Steps</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Add 2 Tbsp butter to a large skillet and place over medium heat. Once
				the butter is melted and sizzling add the frozen seafood mix. Stir and
				cook until the shrimp have turned pink and opaque (3-5 minutes). Be
				careful not to overcook the seafood. It should still be soft and supple.
				Remove the seafood from the skillet to a clean bowl and set it aside.
			</li>
			<li>
				Mince the garlic and add it to the skillet with two additional
				tablespoons butter. Sauté the garlic in the butter and the juices from
				the seafood for 1-2 minutes, or just until it has softened and becomes
				very fragrant.
			</li>
			<li>
				Add the can of whole peeled tomatoes with their juices and 1/4 tsp red
				pepper flakes (optional). Use a spatula or spoon to break the tomatoes
				into pieces. Let the skillet come up to a simmer over medium heat, then
				turn the heat down to meidum-low. Continue to simmer the skillet,
				stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes. Continue to break the tomatoes
				into smaller bits every time you stir.
			</li>
			<li>
				After simmering the sauce for about 15 minutes, bring a large pot of
				water to a boil for the pasta. Cook the pasta in the boiling water for
				7-10 minutes, or until al dente. Drain the pasta in a colander.
			</li>
			<li>
				Once the sauce is finished simmering, add 1/2 tsp of salt. Stir to
				combine, taste, and adjust the salt more if needed.
