			It’s almost Thanksgiving and we’re all about to pull our hair out, right??
			But in the middle of all this madness, we still need to eat. So, I reached
			into my pantry today to make up a quick pasta dish using leftovers I had
			on hand. This Spicy Seafood Pasta with Tomato Butter Sauce is a hybrid of
			my Spicy Shrimp Tomato Pasta and 5-Ingredient Butter Tomato Sauce. Both of
			these recipes are great bases that can be customized to accommodate
			leftovers, like the 1/2 pound of frozen seafood mix from Trader Joe’s that
			I had in my freezer.
