			Soft-boiled eggs are my new obsession. The whites of the eggs are firm,
			but the yolk stays silky, creamy, and in a liquid gold state. It’s a
			little like a cross between butter and melted cheese. They’re seriously
			divine. And they’re not just for breakfast! I enjoy soft-boiled eggs with
			toast, as an addition to bowl meals, as a topper for salads or soup
			(hello, ramen!), or just as a quick snack. I pretty much add soft-boiled
			eggs to everything I eat, no matter what time of day. Are you ready to see
			how easy it is?
