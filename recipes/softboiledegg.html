			Soft-boiled eggs are my new obsession. The whites of the eggs are firm,
			but the yolk stays silky, creamy, and in a liquid gold state. It’s a
			little like a cross between butter and melted cheese. They’re seriously
			divine. And they’re not just for breakfast! I enjoy soft-boiled eggs with
			toast, as an addition to bowl meals, as a topper for salads or soup
			(hello, ramen!), or just as a quick snack. I pretty much add soft-boiled
			eggs to everything I eat, no matter what time of day. Are you ready to see
			how easy it is?

			<li>
				Add 1 inch of water to a sauce pot, cover, and bring to a boil over high

				Once boiling, add an egg (or however many you’d like as long as they are
				in a single layer in the bottom of the pot), straight from the
				refrigerator into the pot. Replace the lid and let it continue to boil
				for exactly six minutes.

				After six minutes, remove the egg(s) from the pot and place them in an
				ice water bath or run under cool water until they are cool enough to
				handle. Peel, and enjoy!
