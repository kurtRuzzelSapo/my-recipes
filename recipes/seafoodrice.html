    <p>I started watching One Piece almost 15 years ago and it remains one of my favorite series to date. As someone who loves to make food, I have a special place in my heart for Sanji, who not only cooks well, but also preaches a certain respect for food that I find admirable. “To me, any hungry person’s a customer. The vast ocean can be very cruel. It’s awful to not have any food or water…just awful…I understand starving people more than anyone. I don’t care if you wanna die with dignity, but if you eat up, you’d be able to look forward to a new tomorrow, won’t you?”, said Sanji as he presented a pirate who hadn’t eaten for days with a piping hot plate of seafood rice. This dish is the first of Sanji’s that we see in the series and brings back strong feelings of nostalgia.</p>
