			I started watching One Piece almost 15 years ago and it remains one of my
			favorite series to date. As someone who loves to make food, I have a
			special place in my heart for Sanji, who not only cooks well, but also
			preaches a certain respect for food that I find admirable. “To me, any
			hungry person’s a customer. The vast ocean can be very cruel. It’s awful
			to not have any food or water…just awful…I understand starving people more
			than anyone. I don’t care if you wanna die with dignity, but if you eat
			up, you’d be able to look forward to a new tomorrow, won’t you?”, said
			Sanji as he presented a pirate who hadn’t eaten for days with a piping hot
			plate of seafood rice. This dish is the first of Sanji’s that we see in
			the series and brings back strong feelings of nostalgia.

		<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>2/3 cup jasmine rice</li>
			<li>1 1/2 cup water</li>
			<li>1 green onion</li>
			<li>150g seafood medley</li>
			<li>3 eggs</li>
			<li>1 tsp salt</li>
			<li>2 tbsp oil</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Steps</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Wash the rice twice, drain, and cook with the 1 1/2 cup water. Wait
				until the rice is cooked before proceeding with the rest of the steps.
			</li>
			<li>Cut the green onion into thin circular pieces and set aside.</li>
			<li>
				Using 1 tbsp oil, stir fry the seafood medley until fully cooked.
				Careful not to overdo it, but make sure it’s not raw.
			</li>
			<li>
				Beat the eggs until even. In a hot pan, add a tbsp oil and the egg.
				While the egg is still half raw, put in the rice and mix together. If
				using a cast iron pan like what I used, stir fry on medium heat so that
				the egg and rice don’t stick. Once all the egg is mixed in well with the
				rice and cooked, it’s ok to turn up the heat to high to get more aroma.
			</li>
			<li>Add in the seafood medley and mix.</li>
			<li>
				Add in the green onion and turn off the heat. Mix well immediately with
				the heat off to have the flavors of the green onion infuse into the
				rice, but not be overcooked.
			</li>
		</ol>
